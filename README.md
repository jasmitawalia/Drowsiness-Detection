# Drowsiness-Detection

# Introduction to the problem: state of the art:
The main idea behind this project is to develop a nonintrusive system which can
detect fatigue of any human and can issue a timely warning. Drivers who do not take
regular breaks when driving long distances run a high risk of becoming drowsy a
state which they often fail to recognize early enough. According to the expert’s
studies show that around one quarter of all serious motorway accidents are
attributable to sleepy drivers in need of a rest, meaning that drowsiness causes more
road accidents than drink-driving. This system will monitor the driver eyes using a
camera and by developing an algorithm we can detect symptoms of driver fatigue
early enough to avoid the person from sleeping. So, this project will be helpful in
detecting driver fatigue in advance and will give warning output in form of alarm and
popups.
Moreover , the warning will be deactivated manually rather than automatically . For
this purpose, a deactivation dialog will be generated which will contain some simple
mathematical operation which when answered correctly will dismiss the warning. If
driver feels drowsy there is possibility of incorrect response to the dialog. We can
judge this by plotting a graph in time domain. If all the three input variables show a
possibility of fatigue at one moment, then a Warning signal is given in form of text
and sound. This will directly give an indication of drowsiness/fatigue which can be
further used as record of driver performance.
Also The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each
other. Face recognition is a personal identification system that uses personal
characteristics of a person to identify the person&#39;s identity. Human face recognition
procedure basically consists of two phases, namely face detection, where this
process takes place very rapidly in humans, except under conditions where the
object is located at a short distance away, the next is the introduction, which

recognize a face as individuals. Stage is then replicated and developed as a model
for facial image recognition (face recognition) is one of the much-studied biometrics
technology and developed by experts. There are two kinds of methods that are
currently popular in developed face recognition pattern namely, Eigenface method
and Fisherface method. Facial image recognition Eigenface method is based on the
reduction of facedimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
facial features. The main purpose of the use of PCA on face recognition using Eigen
faces was formed (face space) by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the
largest eigenvalue of the face image. The area of this project face detection system
with face recognition is Image processing.

# Justification for the Project:
Various investigations show that driver&#39;s drowsiness is one of the main causes of
road accidents. The current technology in digital computer system allows researchers
around the world to study the fatigue behaviour. The purpose of this study is to detect
the drowsiness in drivers to prevent the accidents and to improve the safety on the
highways. Real time face detection is implemented to locate driver&#39;s face region. In
this project the eye blink of the driver is detected. If the drivers eyes remain closed
for more than a certain period of time, the driver is said to be drowsy and an alarm is
sounded. The programming is done in python language and Open CV using the
Haarcascade library for the detection of facial features. In this project we aim to
develop drowsiness system. 
A day to day car security level grown up to provide security at our hands. IOT based
face recognition can be implemented. A standard web camera to capture the image
to identify who is driving the car. It’s a method that identifies the car owner. If the face
recognizes person is not the owner , it will greet them by name and the car will be
start the engine. If they are not identified car will not start and send alert message to
owner. The system will perform detection and recognition rapidly in real time when
face in front of camera. This project basic utilizes the camera, and then internet
connection to create a car starts itself by facial recognition. If the user in the car is
recognized, car will starts! If not system send alert to owner and request OTP if OTP
matches then car starts and new user database uploads. 

# Expected Scientific Output/Intellectual Property Generation
a. Firstly we will implement face detection unlock and OTP unlock ( secondary option) .
The starting of the engine will depend on the intelligence of the car.
b. If the face is detected properly , then only the engine of the car will start . We will
use and OTP unlock method as an secondary option , in case when a guest driver will
be driving the car .
c. While Driving , if drowsiness is detected , the alarm will start beeping . If the alarm is
not stopped manually , the system of the car will automatically make the car to
come at a state of rest .
